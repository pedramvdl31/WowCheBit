          <p class="wow fadeInUp animated" style="visibility: visible;">  
          <p>UBU TODAY is a 501C3 Non-Profit Organization.</p>
          <p>UBU Today's vision is to have a retreat center that functions as a conduit to healing trauma, restoring, renewing & revitalizing. Ultimately resulting in the free flow of vital energy.
          YOU CAN BE YOU TODAY.</p>
          <h4>IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS:</h4>
          Securing funding, grants and Federal support that in turn will allow organic growth to occur. For example, a budget for staff, funding that allows participants to participate regardless of financial contraints, the ability to compensate the modalities that we partner with - this is a collaborative effort.
          <h4>☆ Intermediate Immediate Steps:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Prepare for exposure and funding to begin</li>
            <li>Prepare for exposure and funding to begin</li>
            <li>Create a interim forum to host events - Lake House</li>
            <li>Identify Interns to assist with grant writing, coordination and scheduling of events, logistics, finalizing and creating additional social
             media sites, networking with local forums with similar interests.</li>
             <li>Creating a weekly Meet Up Group</li>
             <li>Dues Proposal</li>
             <li>Scouting avaliable retreat centers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This IS ALL "viable" if its meant to be.</p>
          <p>UBU TODAY must, creatively move forward beginning with the end on mind and working with what may be perceived as barriers (opportunities)....
          A perceived "Set Back" = opportunity for a grand "Come Back".</p>
          <h4>GROUP INTENT:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The intent of this group is to provide a confidential forum for all
            participants that have registered and / or attended past and future
              events of alternative modalities hosted by UBU Today.</li>
            <li>
              A intentional and safe space that facilitates community and will
               allow us to nurture the bonds that have been created.
            </li>
            <li>
              A safe space without judgment for us to support and lean on one another
               when necessary, have fun, laugh, love and discuss other modalities that desire exploration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Please utilize this forum to connect with each other. It is not a 
              "formal" group - yet more of a centralized avenue to stay connected.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>☆☆☆This is now be the official "UBU Today" forum for all participants and ongoing particpants will be added as appropriate☆☆☆</h4>
          <p>
          The "Cocoon-US One" Group will still exist and be utilized solely for the Cocoon discussions and or confidential discussions related to workshops attended.
