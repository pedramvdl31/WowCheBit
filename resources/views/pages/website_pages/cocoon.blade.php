			Healing trauma with massage, vital breath, meditation and conscious touch
			Massage et Respiration Chamanique
			Consciousness + Energy = Healing
			A physical, meditative, tantric and shamanic experience, which reconnects and transforms the body’s vital energy. 
			<br>
			<br>
			By merging touch, vibration and breath with the body’s pulsations, the heart and body consciously create a profound space of relaxation and trust in the Universe and Divine.The reconnection process assists in clearing blocked chakras and provides healing, resulting in the free flow of vital energy!This experience allows one to feel fully alive with an abundance of Joy!
			The Cocoon Workshops targets three levels: physical, emotional and spiritual
			Presence: Shamanic “Vital Breath” (breathwork) exercises are incorporated throughout the workshop. This allows a safe forum to release traumatic, emotional or sexual blockages that often unconsciously manifest in the body. A safe release of these blockages creates the ability to connect with one’s self and the universe (Biodanza Structure).
			<br>
			<br>
			Consciousness: Daily meditation exercises reaffirm the unity of the body – soul – spirit (1-2 evening shamanic / tantric rituals).Massage: The massage is spiritual, healing, sensual and tender. The technique involves conscious touch and resourcing. It is practiced while being centered and connected to the “vital” (life) energy.Daily demonstration and initiation to the basic techniques of the Cocoon modality will be followed by a massage exchange with a partner of choice.
			A Cocoon Workshop: Aims to restore flow and irrigate the 7 chakras, which allows one to unify their body, heart and spirit.
